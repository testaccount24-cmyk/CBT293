Sam,

I have been reading your articles in "Technical Support" since
they first began.  They are always interesting.  In the February
issue you wrote about "Defining Dataset Characteristics" and the
CKIEBGEN program.  You had some suggestions on some improvements
you would like in CKIEBGEN and left it up to some of the readers
to make the changes.  It sounded interesting to me so I did make
some changes to the program as you suggested.  Following is the
source code for the changed CKIEBGEN.  Following the source code
is an example of what the new information looks like when the
program runs.
