Sample report from a test run follows.   (After Warren's changes)


  CKIEBGEN - SEQUENTIAL COPY PROGRAM
     SYSUT1 DSN = W1883.TSO.PDS
        MEMBER  = ALLOC
        DSORG   = PO
        BLKSIZE =       23,440
        LRECL   =           80
        RECFM   = FB
     SYSUT2 DSN = W1883.TEST.DATA.SET
        MEMBER  =
        DSORG   = PS
        BLKSIZE =       23,440
        LRECL   =           80
        RECFM   = FB
    RECORDS  IN =           11
    RECORDS OUT =           11


Hope the changes to CKIEBGEN are useful.
